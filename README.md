# FT-Magnitude-phase-Mixer

The Fourier transform is a crucial tool in signal processing, and this project aims to help users understand the importance of the magnitude and phase components of a signal. The software allows users to open and view two images and choose from different components (FT Magnitude, FT Phase, FT Real, FT Imaginary) to display for each image. Additionally, users can mix different components from the two images using a mixing panel that includes options such as uniform magnitude and phase. The software generates an output image based on the user's mixing choices and displays it in real-time. This project's goal is to provide an interactive and user-friendly interface that helps users visualize and comprehend the Fourier transform's significance in signal processing.
